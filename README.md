📡 HMBO-TTPA-NOMA: Intelligent Power Allocation for 5G/Beyond IoT Sensor Networks
🚀 Overview

This project proposes an advanced communication framework called HMBO-TTPA-NOMA designed for efficient, low-latency, and energy-aware data transmission in dense IoT-based ad-hoc sensor networks.

With the rapid growth of IoT-enabled 5G and beyond networks, traditional orthogonal access and resource allocation schemes struggle with:

Massive device connectivity

High interference

Limited node energy

To address these challenges, this work combines:

🦋 Hybrid Monarch Butterfly Optimization (HMBO)
🌳 Tree Topology Power Allocation (TTPA)
📶 Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA)
🧠 Reinforcement Learning (RL)

The system is especially suitable for mission-critical IoT applications, such as:

Disaster recovery systems

Remote healthcare monitoring

Environmental and agricultural sensing

🎯 Key Contributions

✔ Hybrid bio-inspired optimization (HMBO) for intelligent relay selection
✔ Tree-based power allocation (TTPA) for energy-efficient routing
✔ NOMA-based codebook allocation for improved spectral efficiency
✔ Resource decisions based on:

Residual node energy

Traffic load

Channel quality

✔ Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) at the sink node
✔ Reinforcement Learning (RL) for adaptive, long-term decision optimization
